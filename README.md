# FEATURES
1) Check Individuals And Crowds Wearing Masks In Public

2) Use Digital Screens To Remind Visitors To Wear Masks

3) Alert Staff When No Masks Are Detected

4) Works With Existing USB Or IP Cameras

5) Anonymous & Spoof Proof

# USE CASES/ WHERE IT ALL CAN BE USED

# Retail
Retailers need to monitor their premises to control the current occupancy and wearing of masks. Digital screens can be used to display information for
both the number of people allowed in the store and mask detection.

# Airport
This face mask detector can be very effectively used at airports mainly for entrance flow management and monitoring. The software can be added to any access
gate or entrance to make sure that all passengers follow the safety rules when boarding a plane.

# Public Transport
Wearing face masks in public transport will be mandatory in many parts of the world. Public transport organizations can use the software to automate the checking
process with very little resources needed and with efficiency.

# Coorperate Buildings
With many office buildings opening up and employees coming back to work, face mask detection can be used to maintain a safe environment for everyone. The mask detection 
system can send alerts or reminders to those not complying.










# HOW TO SET UP THIS API IN LOCAL

1) download the whole package 
2) open the terminal
# IMPORTANCT 3) connect with directory
4) type "dir" after the location of the file for eg -
## for eg - C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\Flask>dir
5) then type the folder name where the main.py is located, for example in my case it was a folder named Flask consisting a folder named Flask which had file main.py
so type cd"FILE NAME" after the location 
## for eg- C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\Flask>cd Flask

6) Then in the same terminal type python main.py after stating the dir loctaion f
## for eg- C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\Flask\Flask>python main.py
7) after this the api will start to run.
8) To see the api working click on this in the terminal http://127.0.0.1:5000
which will be located in the following screenshot

9) to see the api working click on my website "TRY NOW" button on the nav bar and the api will start to work
## NOTE - If you face error during the code such like - importing of libraries kindly import the libraries by command - pip install "name of the package".           for eg - pip install keras.models


# TO STOP THIS API 
1) click on the terminal 
2) press CTRL + C
3) the api will be closed 






# FUTURISTIC APPROACH
mask detection technology is trained to detect all the variations of face masks that are available. From medical masks to personalized cloth masks, the system will
accurately detect and confirm mask compliance.

Face mask detection is an AI based technology that analyzes a video stream to detect and recognize a face mask worn by an individual person. Every individual is 
classified either as ‘wearing a mask’ or flagged as ‘not wearing a mask’. If the face mask detector application identifies a user as not wearing a mask, a custom 
message can be delivered via a digital screen to remind all visitors to wear masks before entering the premises.

According to the guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO) a face mask needs to cover the face fully, including the nose and the chin.Therefore, the
detector only classifies someone as wearing a mask if these conditions are satisfied. software is also spoof proof which means that it understands if you’re
covering your face with a hand or an object other than a mask.






# NOTE
I couldnt host the website on any platforms like heroku and github etc, because the size of my api was too large and that was hendering to deploy.Hence here is the 
project I worked on past month. I chose this topic as it's a major issue in this world and specially in India that people with or without reason dont wear mask
when they are outside, this API will make them relase the importance of mask and hence will lower down the spread of virus.

LASTLY, I wanna thank MICROSOFT organization for giving such a great opportunity to work on something exicting and learn something new everyday. 
I wanna thank my mentor Shri for helping me where ever i got stuck and my friends for clearing my doubts and helping me grow more on this topic :"). 

--------------------------------------------------------- THANK YOU MICROSOFT FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY--------------------------------------------------------------------------
